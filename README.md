This repository is made for a Gamemaker project for the gamejam [Make Something Horrible 2018](https://itch.io/jam/make-something-horrible-2018). The gamejam subject was : "What if games changed creators?". I found the idea of "What if Sid Meier (main creator of the Civilisation series) would make PlayerUnknown's Battleground?". It resulted with me making a top-down turn-based battleroyale strategy game.

The game can be found [here](https://deluvi.itch.io/cid-le-meilleurs-battleground). Of course, as the title of the gamejam suggest, it is horrible.
